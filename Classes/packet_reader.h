 * The packet buffers need to be as long than the longest packet we

 * an entire packet for checksumming...
 * First we thought it had to be big enough for a SiRF Measured Tracker
 * Data packet (188 bytes). Then it had to be big enough for a UBX SVINFO
 * packet (206 bytes). Now it turns out that a couple of ITALK messages are
 * over 512 bytes. I know we like verbose output, but this is ridiculous.

 * long/slow context switch will cause the next read from the serial
